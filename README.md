## If you are curious

- [This](https://www.figma.com/file/BgglezVAZ0KCFjpi2axwtH/Puppy-Radar?t=JUhMqcxdbxHcaZ5s-1) is the Figma file I made for the UI/UX design of the website.
- The website added as many aria-label or related aria attributes as possible to be accessible to screen reader, but I may miss some due to the quick turnover.
